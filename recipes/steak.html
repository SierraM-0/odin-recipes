        <h3>Steps to make Steak with Red Wine Sauce</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Steak:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove 
                    excess moisture. Season generously with salt and 
                    pepper on both sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large skillet or cast iron pan, heat the 
                    olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the steaks to the hot pan and sear for about 
                    3-4 minutes on each side (for medium-rare), or 
                    longer according to your desired doneness. For 
                    thicker steaks, you may need to finish them in 
                    the oven preheated to 400°F (200°C) after searing, 
                    until they reach your preferred internal temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Optional: </em>Add smashed garlic cloves and fresh 
                    thyme or rosemary sprigs to the pan during the 
                    last minute of cooking to infuse flavors.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br> 

            <li><strong>Make the Red Wine Sauce:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the same skillet used for searing the steaks 
                    (pour off excess fat if necessary, leaving about 1 
                    tablespoon), reduce the heat to medium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the chopped shallot and cook until softened, about 
                    2-3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute until 
                    fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle the flour over the shallot and garlic mixture, 
                    stirring constantly, and cook for 1-2 minutes to create 
                    a roux.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slowly pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned 
                    bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer until the wine 
                    is reduced by half, about 5-7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the beef broth and simmer for another 5 minutes 
                    until the sauce has thickened slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the butter 
                    until melted and incorporated into the sauce. Season 
                    with salt and pepper to taste.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Transfer the steaks to serving plates and spoon the 
                    red wine sauce over the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and cracked 
                    black pepper, if desired.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve immediately, accompanied by your choice of 
                    side dishes such as roasted potatoes, grilled 
                    vegetables, or a simple green salad.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tips</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Steak Doneness: </strong>Use a meat thermometer 
                to ensure your steak reaches your desired level of doneness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Red Wine: </strong>Choose a red wine that you enjoy 
                drinking, as the flavors will concentrate in the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Resting Time: </strong>Allow the steaks to rest for 
                a few minutes before slicing to retain juices and 
                ensure tenderness.
            </li>
