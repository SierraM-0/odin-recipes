    <h3>Steps to make Seafood Pasta</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pasta and Seafood:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water 
                according to package instructions until al dente. 
                Drain and set aside, reserving about 1 cup of pasta 
                cooking water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large 
                skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and 
                red pepper flakes, saut√©ing until fragrant, about 1 
                minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the mixed seafood to the skillet and cook until 
                just opaque and cooked through. Remove the seafood 
                from the skillet and set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. 
                Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 
                1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the lemon zest and juice, and season with 
                salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the cooked seafood to the skillet and toss 
                to coat in the lemon garlic butter sauce. Remove 
                from heat.

            <li>
                Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the seafood 
                and toss gently to combine, adding reserved pasta 
                cooking water as needed to loosen the sauce and coat 
                the pasta evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the halved cherry tomatoes and chopped parsley. 
                Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

            <li>
                Divide the seafood pasta among serving plates or bowls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese 
                if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately while hot, accompanied by crusty bread 
                and a glass of white wine.
            </li>

    <h3>Tips</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Seafood Selection: </strong>Use a variety of 
            seafood for depth of flavor. Ensure all seafood is 
            cleaned and deveined properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pasta Cooking Water: </strong>The starchy pasta 
            water helps create a silky sauce when combined with the 
            lemon garlic butter mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Variations: </strong>Add a touch of cream for 
            a richer sauce, or incorporate spinach or arugula for 
            added freshness.
        </li>
    </ul>
